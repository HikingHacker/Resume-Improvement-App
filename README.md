# Resume Improvement Tool

This application helps users improve their resume bullet points using Claude AI. It provides AI-powered suggestions to enhance resume content.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main parts:

1. **Client** - React frontend application
2. **Server** - Express backend server that handles Claude API calls

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Server Setup

First, set up the backend server:

```bash
# Navigate to the server directory
cd server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm run dev
```

The server will run on http://localhost:3001.

### 2. Client Setup

Then, set up the frontend client:

```bash
# Return to the main project directory
cd ..

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the client
npm start
```

The client will run on http://localhost:3000.


## Available Scripts

In the client directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
